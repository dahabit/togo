## Togo

This is an implementation of the classic To Do/Task web application, based on the Laravel 4 PHP framework and the AngularJS framework. The backend application is exposed via an authenticated RESTful API which interfaces with the client-side MVC implementation in AngularJS to dynamically update and interact with the backend.
